1.  what is prompt ? Term prompt means the program show a window to convey a message 
2.  which operator do you use to read into variable ? cin
3.  if you want the user to input the integer value to your program for a variable named
    number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and
    to input the value into your program ? 
    -   ask user to do          : cout<<"enter an integer number : ";
    -   input value to program  : cin>>number;
4.  what is \n called and what purpose does it serve ? 
    it is called new line maybe (if im right :D)
    it is designed to give new line to the output character
5.  what terminates input into string ? (enter character)
6.  what terminates iput into integer ? (enter character)
7.  how would you write 
    cout<<"Hello, ";
    cout<<first_name;
    cout<<"!\n";
    answer  :   cout<<"Hello, "<<first_name<<"!\n";
8.  what is an object ? 
    object is some place in memory that contains a value (bits) 
9.  what is literal ?
    literal is a value of particular type 
10. what kinds of literals are there ? 
    literals of integers, strings, chars, doubles, floats, and booleans
11. what is variable ? 
    variable is named location or place in memory that contains value
12. what are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double ? 
    char    :   1 byte
    integer :   4 bytes
    double  :   8 bytes
13. what measures do we use for the size of small entitities in memory, such as ints and strings ? 
    byte
14. what is the difference between '=' and '==' ?
    '=' is used to assign value to a variable 
    '==' is used to in logical comparison which is equal comparison
15. what is a defenition ?
    defenition is a statement where we declare a variable and initialize it for the first terminates
16. what is an initialization and how does it differs from an assignment ?
    -   initialization is a statement that gives value to a variable for the first time after it is declared
    or when it is defined
    -   it differs from an asignment because it only happened when a variable gets a value first time
17. what is a string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++ ? 
    string concatenation is a combined of literal strings or string objects 
    we make it work in C++ thourg + operator. e.g : 
    if s1 and s2 is a string type then it will make string concatenation
    s1 + s2 or "Hello " + "World"
18. legal names in C++ :
    -   This_little_pig
    -   MineMineMine
    -   the_$12_method
    -   number
    -   correct?
    not legal names and why : 
    -   latest thing :  because it contains a space
    -   This_1_is fine :   because it contains a space
    -   2_For_1_special :   because it starts with number instead of letters
    -   _this_is_ok :   because it starts whit underscode instead of letters
19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because thay are likely to cause confusion
    -   correct?
    -   MineMineMine
    -   the_$12_method
    -   PHI
    -   Price($)
20. What are some good rules for choosing names ? 
    -   starts with letters    
    -   short named
    -   describe what it serves as a container, e.g :  first_name  : variable to contain a first_name
    -   follow standard convention
    -   dont use appropriate symbol except you must
21. what is type safety and why is it important ? 
    type safety is whatever operation performed on a type that doesnt break the rule or doesnt lose value when 
    it is converted to another type
    it is important because if we lose value then that could lead to bug
22. why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing ? 
    because double is bigger than int. if bigger type is converted to a smaller type it could lead to truncated value
23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.
    the rule is :   whenever bigger type is converted to smaller type than that is unsafe type conversion
                    whenever smaller type is converted to bigger type than that is safe type conversion
